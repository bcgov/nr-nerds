Improve Test Coverage for Author Assignment\n- Add tests to verify author information is correctly passed through from `add-items.js` to `assignees.js`\n- Test cases needed:\n  - PR authored by monitored user but in non-monitored repo\n  - PR in monitored repo but authored by someone else\n  - PR authored by monitored user and in monitored repo\n  - Verify author field is preserved in object passed between modules\n- Goal: Prevent future regressions in assignee logic when modifying data passed between modules\n\n## 5. Modularize Requirements Parsing and Action Logic\n- Refactor the script to further separate requirements parsing from action logic.\n- Make it easier to add new rules or support more organizations in the future.\n\n## 6. Support for More Organizations or Custom Rules\n- Allow configuration of additional organizations or custom rules in rules.yml\n- Make the script more flexible for multi-org or multi-project use cases.\n\n## 7. Enhanced Logging and Diagnostics\n- Add more granular logging (e.g., per-repo, per-action) and allow output to a file as well as the console.\n- Optionally, add a summary of skipped items with reasons to a separate log file.\n\n## 8. Slack/Teams/Email Notifications\n- Integrate with Slack, Microsoft Teams, or email to send notifications for key automation events, errors, or summary reports.\n\n## 9. Web Dashboard or Status Page\n- Build a simple web dashboard to visualize project sync status, recent changes, errors, and upcoming sprints.\n\n## 10. Configurable Batch Size and Rate Limits\n- Allow batch size and API rate limit settings to be configured via rules.yml or environment variables for easier tuning.\n\n## 11. Self-Check/Healthcheck Command\n"}
