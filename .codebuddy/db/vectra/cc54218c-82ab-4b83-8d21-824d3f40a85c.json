Each item can be promoted to a GitHub issue or PR as needed.\n\n## User Assignment Enhancements\n\n### 1. Support for Multiple Assignees\n- Enhance the `assignUserToProjectItem` function to support multiple assignees\n- Add configuration for team assignments based on repository or PR/issue type\n- Useful for larger teams with specialized roles or for assigning both a primary and backup resource\n\n### 2. Content-Based User Assignment\n- Add logic to assign different users based on content of PR or issue\n- Examples: Assign security team members for security-related PRs, documentation team for doc changes\n- Could use labels, PR title keywords, or file paths to determine appropriate assignee\n\n### 3. User Assignment Configuration Options\n- Add configurable options for user assignment behavior in rules.yml\n- Options could include:\n  - `assignPRsToAuthor`: Whether to automatically assign PRs to their author\n  - `inheritAssigneesForLinkedIssues`: Whether linked issues inherit PR assignees\n  - `preserveExistingAssignees`: Whether to keep existing assignees when updating\n  - `defaultAssignee`: The default user to assign when no specific user is determined\n    - Examples: Fallback user for PRs with no author, default maintainer for new issues, or a team account for workflow automation\n\n## 1. Dry-Run Mode\n- Add a command-line or config option to run the script in \"dry run\" mode, where no changes are made to GitHub, but all actions are logged as if they would be performed.\n- Useful for testing changes to requirements or code without affecting the project board.\n\n## 2. Audit Trail / State Diff Logging\n- Implement a feature to log the before/after state of each project item that is changed.\n- Optionally, write a summary of all changes to a file for later review or rollback.\n\n## 3. Unit Tests for Requirements Parsing and Item Selection\n"}
