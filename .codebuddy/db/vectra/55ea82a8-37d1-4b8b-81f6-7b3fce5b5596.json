For example:\n- Edit the rules or repository list below.\n- Ask Copilot: \"Please update the automation based on requirements.md\" or \"Sync the code with the latest requirements.\"\n- Or, create a GitHub issue or pull request referencing requirements.md and request an update.\n\n## Rule Adherence and Quality\nThe following principles must be followed to maintain strict adherence to requirements:\n\n1. **Rules Are Explicit** - If something isn't in the rules tables above, it should not be implemented.\n2. **No Implicit Behavior** - All automation must map directly to a rule in this file.\n"}
