It handles:\n\n- Adding PRs and issues to the project board\n- Assigning users to PRs and issues\n- Moving items to the appropriate columns based on state\n- Managing sprint assignments\n- Processing linked issues when PRs are merged\n\n## Configuration\n\nAll automation is configured in `config/rules.yml`. The configuration includes:\n- Project settings\n- Monitored repositories and users\n- Business rules for automation\n- Performance settings\n\n### Project Configuration\n\nThe tool supports multiple ways to specify the GitHub project:\n\n1. **Project URL (Recommended)**: Use the GitHub project URL\n   ```bash\n   export PROJECT_URL=https://github.com/orgs/bcgov/projects/16\n   ```\n   The system will automatically resolve the project ID from the URL.\n\n2. **Project ID**: Use the GitHub project ID directly\n   ```bash\n   export PROJECT_ID=PVT_kwDOAA37OM4AFuzg\n   ```\n\n3. **Configuration File**: Add to `config/rules.yml`\n   ```yaml\n   project:\n     url: https://github.com/orgs/bcgov/projects/16\n     # or\n     id: PVT_kwDOAA37OM4AFuzg\n   ```\n\nThe URL resolution feature automatically extracts the organization and project number from GitHub project URLs and resolves them to the correct project ID via the GitHub API.\n\nSee `TECHNICAL.md` for implementation details and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for development guidelines.\n\n## Files\n\n- `project-board-sync.js`: The main script that runs the automation\n- `config/rules.yml`: Source of truth for all automation rules\n- `TECHNICAL.md`: Implementation details and architecture\n- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Development guidelines and processes\n- `FUTURE-IDEAS.md`: Ideas and plans for future enhancements\n"}
