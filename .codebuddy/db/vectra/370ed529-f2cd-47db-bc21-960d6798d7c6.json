Board Addition Rules: Add items to project board\n2. Column Rules: Set appropriate column\n3. Sprint Rules: Assign sprints based on column\n4. Linked Issue Rules: Sync issue states with PRs\n5. Assignee Rules: Manage PR/Issue assignments\n\n### Validation & Verification\n- Column transitions follow strict rules defined in config/rules.yml\n- Sprint assignments respect board state and column rules\n- Assignee changes tracked and verified on both project and repository\n- All state changes logged for audit purposes\n- Automatic rollback on failed state transitions\n- State consistency checks after each operation\n\n### API Usage & Optimization\n- Rate limit aware processing with backoff\n- Optimized API calls to minimize quota usage\n- Retry logic for transient failures\n- Batch operations where possible\n- Cache frequently accessed data\n- Handle GitHub API eventual consistency\n\n## Configuration\n\n"}
